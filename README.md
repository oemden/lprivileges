# Linux Privileges


## Description
**Linux Privileges** or `lprivileges` is designed to allow users to work as a standard user for day-to-day use, by providing a quick and easy way to get administrator rights when needed. When you do need admin rights, you can get them by clicking on the Privileges icon in your favorites, or by calling `lprivilegesreq` in your Terminal.

Working as a standard user instead of an administrator adds another layer of security to your Linux device and is considered a security best practice. Linux Privileges helps users to request Privileges escalation only when required.

`lprivileges` is inspired by [SAP Privileges](https://github.com/SAP/macOS-enterprise-privileges) and an attempt to get a similar tool on Linux, and is in early development.


## Installation
Installation is easy. Clone the repo.

```
cd /into/the/repo
sudo ./install-Linux-Privileges.sh
```

## Config file

Some Settings can be customized by editing the config file `lprivileges.conf`

Settings should be edited prior to installation if installed manually or deployed with some management tool.

- custom configuration file can be found in the file: `./etc/lprivileges.conf`
- It will be located in folder '/usr/local/etc/lprivileges' after installation.
- Do not change `lprivileges.global.conf`

## Usage

All scripts are installed in `/usr/local/bin` and available in your `$PATH`

To request Privileges run `lprivilegesreq`

For now usage is simple:

### Gnome Desktop:

If the icon is not in your favorite bar, search for the app in the 'Show Applications' in your Desktop. The favorite icon will be created at the first request in any case. 

Desktop App is a shorcut, and will open up a terminal window just like if you called `lprivilegesreq` from Terminal.


### Terminal 

run `lprivilegesreq`

Press Any Key or ctrl-C to cancel

```

- Finish this readme.
- Allow â‰  number of reasons.
	- manage `Other reason` in case we change the number of reasons.
- Allow display Texts to be changed.
- Fusion ( or not ) `lprivilegesreq` with `lprivileges`
- Send message thru Terminal for users connected over ssh
- "autodemote at login" option
- Request demote without waiting for timer to end.
- Finetuning user's icon Favorite creation in Gnome.
	- Sometimes when the Application is created, the Application icon is not added to user's favorite.
	- The icon favorite is automatically added at the first user request.
- Add a GUI for the `request` - `demote` in GNOME ?
- Improve text display and user interaction.
- Allow input for the request -aka `lprivileges -r "some reason"`
- Display Status in request
	- -> propose to demote if user is admin.
	- -> propose to grant is user is standard user.
- Adapt App Icon to unlocked if the user is admin during the installation.
